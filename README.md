Number Plate Detector and Saver-OPEN CV + Virtual Whiteboard-Open CV

This is a simple python project using Python, numpy and OpenCV where when we take 
any image or a video as an input or any input from webcam the script will identify the 
number plate of the car if it is present in the image and extract and save the number plate in 
a folder in jpeg format.

In the Virtual whiteboard we can draw in the air using markers of various colors. The code identifies the 
markers and lets us draw while the webcam is on.
